# Snowflake-Ingestion-from-Databricks
Connect Databricks notebook to Snowflake for querying and execute direct commands. 

This is a solution to manage Snowflake Databases from Databricks including executing SQL commands and fetch results back to Databricks for further processing.

1. Connect to Snowflake Environment from Databricks
2. CREATE Schema and Tables
3. INSERT data to Snowflake tables
4. View and verify data from Snowflake tables
5. Run SQL Queries in Snowflake programmatically
6. Fetch Data back to Databricks
7. Further processing using fetched data

Cheers!
